                collected it which may include the following:

                <li>

              <h3>Third Party Links</h3>
              <p>
                Occasionally, We may include or offer third party products or
                services on Our Platform. As such, Our Platform may contain
                links to websites owned and operated by third parties. These
                third-party websites may have their own separate and independent
                privacy policies, which may govern the collection and processing
                of your personal data. We urge you to review these privacy
                policies – because this Notice will not apply. We therefore have
                no responsibility or liability for the content, activities and
                privacy practices of such third-party websites.
              </p>
              <h3>Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                Our Website uses cookies (small files containing a string of
                characters), which We place on your computer, if you agree.
                These cookies allow us to uniquely identify your browser and to
                distinguish you from other users of Our Website. This enables us
                to track your preferences and provide you with a personalized
                and smooth experience when you browse Our Website. The cookies
                We use are “analytical” cookies. They allow us to recognize and
                count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around
                the Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the
                way Our Website works, for example by ensuring that users are
                finding what they are looking for easily. We do not share the
                information the cookies collect with any third parties.
              </p>
              <h3>User Profiles</h3>
              <p>
                Every registered user has a unique personal profile. Each
                profile is assigned a unique personal identification number,
                which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you register, We create your profile, assign a personal
                identification number, (your User ID) then send this personal
                identification number back your email address with an activation
                link for the activation of your profile. This code is uniquely
                yours. It is your passport to seamless travel across Our
                Platform, allowing you to use Our Platform without having to
                fill out registration forms with information you’ve already
                provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to
                re-register – just use your User ID to identify yourself.
              </p>
              <h3>Data Security</h3>
              <p>
                We store and process your personal information on Our computers
                in Nigeria. Where We need to transfer your data to another
                country, such country must have an adequate data protection law.
                Please be assured that We have put in place appropriate security
                measures including but not limited to access controls,
                firewalls, data encryption, and physical security to prevent
                your personal data from being lost, altered, disclosed, or
                otherwise used in an unauthorized way. In addition, We limit
                access to your personal data to those employees, agents and
                contractors who have a business need to know. These employees,
                agents, and contractors have a duty to maintain confidentiality
                at all times and will only process your personal data according
                to Our instructions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Also note that We have put in place procedures to deal with any
                suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
                applicable regulator of a breach where We are legally required
                to do so.
              </p>
              <h3>Retention of Personal Information</h3>
              <p>
                We will keep your personal information for as long as it is
                required and in accordance with the purpose it is being
                processed for, or for tax, accounting, regulatory, or legal
                purposes. We will keep the personal data for a period which
                enables us to handle or respond to any complaints, queries or
                concerns relating to Our relationship with you. Related to this,
                We may retain your personal data for a longer period in the
                event of a complaint or if We reasonably believe there is a
                prospect of litigation in respect to Our relationship with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may notify us whenever you no longer wish to hear from us
                and We will keep minimum information upon receipt of such notice
                to ensure that no future contact is made by us. We will actively
                review the personal information We hold and delete it securely,
                or in some cases anonymize it, when there is no longer a legal,
                business or user need for it to be retained.
              </p>
              <h3>Your Legal Rights</h3>
              You have the right to:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  request access to your personal data (commonly known as a
                  "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a
                  copy of the personal information We hold about you and check
                  that We are lawfully processing it. Please note that a data
                  subject access request may attract an administrative fee;
                </li>
                <li>
                  request correction of the personal data that We hold about
                  you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate
                  data We hold about you corrected, though We may need to verify
                  the accuracy of the new data you provide to us;
                </li>
                <li>
                  request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask
                  us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
                  reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the
                  right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where
                  you have successfully exercised your right to object to
                  processing (see below), where We may have processed your
                  information unlawfully or where We are required to erase your
                  personal data to comply with local law. Note however, that We
                  may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure
                  for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
                  applicable, at the time of your request;
                </li>
                <li>
                  object to processing of your personal data where We are
                  relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party)
                  and there is something about your particular situation which
                  makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
                  feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You
                  also have the right to object where We are processing your
                  personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, We
                  may demonstrate that We have compelling legitimate grounds to
                  process your information which override your rights and
                  freedoms;
                </li>
                <li>
                  request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a
                  third party. We will provide you, or a third party you have
                  chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used,
                  machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
                  automated information which you initially provided consent for
                  us to use or where We used the information to perform a
                  contract with you. Please note that this request may also
                  attract an administrative fee;
                </li>
                <li>
                  withdraw consent at any time where We are relying on consent
                  to process your personal data. However, this will not affect
                  the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you
                  withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, We may
                  not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We
                  will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
                  your consent.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Security</h3>
              <p>
                At Afrilearn, We implement a variety of reasonable security
                measures to protect the security and integrity of your personal
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                To prevent unauthorized access to your information, We have
                implemented strong controls and security safeguards at the
                technical and operational levels. Our Platform uses Transport
                Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to ensure secure transmission of your
                personal data. You should see the padlock symbol in your URL
                address bar once you are successfully logged into the platform.
                The URL address will also start with https:// depicting a secure
                Webpage.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please note that you also have a significant role in protecting
                your information. No one can see or edit your personal
                information without knowing your username and password, so do
                not share these with others. However, as the internet is not a
                secure medium, We cannot guarantee that security breaches will
                never occur. Accordingly, We are not responsible for the
                matters, which include actions of hackers and other unauthorized
                third parties that breach Our reasonable security procedure.
